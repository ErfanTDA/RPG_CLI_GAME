# 🧙‍♂️ RPG CLI GAME

Hello everyone!  

This is my first project. It’s not very advanced yet, but over time it will grow into something much more professional.

This project (or future game) is a simple **Command-Line RPG** where you can complete quizzes to earn **gold**.  
After earning gold, you will be able to buy items and upgrade your character as the game expands.

## ▶️ How to Run

After installing the requirements:

   ```

3. Log in to your account:
