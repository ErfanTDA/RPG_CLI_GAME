\# RPG CLI GAME



Hello everyone!  

This is my first project. It’s not very advanced yet, but over time it will grow into something much more professional.



This project (or future game) is a simple \*\*Command-Line RPG\*\* where you can complete quizzes to earn \*\*gold\*\*.  

After earning gold, you will be able to buy items and upgrade your character as the game expands.





\## 🚀 Features (Current Version)



\- Account system (signup \& login)

&nbsp;   

\- Colored command-line interface

&nbsp;   

\- Quiz system for earning gold

&nbsp;   

\- Status command to view your profile

&nbsp;   

\- More features will be added in future versions

&nbsp; 

\## 📦 Requirements



Before running the game, you need to install the required packages.



Run the following command:

```nginx

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

\## ▶️ How to Run



After installing the requirements:



1\. Run the main file:

2\. ```css

&nbsp;  python main.py

&nbsp;  ```

&nbsp;  Create an account using:

3\. ```nginx

&nbsp;  signup

&nbsp;  ```

&nbsp;  Log in to your account:

4\. ```nginx

&nbsp;  login

&nbsp;  ```

&nbsp;  To see all available commands:

5\. ```bash

&nbsp;  help

&nbsp;  ```

&nbsp;  Start completing missions (quizzes) to earn gold:

6\. ```nginx

&nbsp;  quiz

&nbsp;  ```

If you answer correctly, you receive gold. Otherwise, you don't—so think carefully!



\## ✅ Current Progress



The game is still in early development. More systems, missions, items, and gameplay mechanics will be added in future versions.
